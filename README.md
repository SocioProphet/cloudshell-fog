# Cloud Shell (Fog-Optimized) — Minimum Spec (Notes Only)

This repository contains **original notes/specs** for an open-source cloud shell with a fog/distributed-systems twist.

Policy:
- **No IBM diagrams**, screenshots, extracted labels, or copied design artifacts.
- Only clean-room notes: requirements, our architecture, interface contracts, and implementation plans.

Next:
- Write Minimum OSS Spec v0 (planes, components, interfaces)
- Define CI/CD contract (Argo CD Autopilot + Tekton + policy)
